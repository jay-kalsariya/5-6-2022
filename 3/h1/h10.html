        <h2>GMAIL </h2>
        <P style="color: cornflowerblue;"> need to speak with a customer service google tech that can reinstate my Gmail address.
             It was disabled for suspicious "spamming" - they were not unsolicited emails, 
             they were requested info from each party.  Google disabled all the Google sheets, 
             forms, drive, and site associated with that email, AND it shut down the domain
              I purchased that was links to the Google sites website. 
              We are losing money since the website is down, and everything is lost having been connected to that email.  
              If the email is not reinstated- I will need to recreate EVERYTHING. 
               Its urgent that I speak to someone. 
               I cannot find a customer service number for Gmail accounts.
                (NOTE: I did file a appeal and review)</P>
